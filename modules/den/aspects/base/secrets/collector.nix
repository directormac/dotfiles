    # `age-secrets` is a broadcast quirk: a shared-rekeyFile secret (e.g.
    # `registry-password`) is legitimately emitted by several aspects on a
    # single host — the registry host owns it AND the podman `containers`
    # aspect makes the host a recipient of the same `.age`. A naive
    # `lib.mkMerge` then sees two definitions of `age.secrets.registry-password`
    # and conflicts (down to path-vs-string of an otherwise-identical
    # rekeyFile). Deduplicate by secret name instead with a shallow merge:
    # equivalent broadcast emissions collapse to one, last definition wins.
    #
    # This requires every `age-secrets` emitter to return a plain
    # `{ age.secrets = <attrset>; }` (no `mkIf`/`mkMerge` wrappers, which a
    # shallow merge can't see through) — emitters express conditional/iterative
    # secret sets with `optionalAttrs`/`mergeAttrsList` instead.

      # `age.secrets = {}` would fail to evaluate there. This matches the old
      # `lib.mkMerge []` no-op for hosts/guests with no secrets.
