  # Written as a policy record rather than a bare function so it can carry `emits`. The
  # route is value-conditional on `host.system` — the third arm of the same family as the
  # two above — so a body fired at a sentinel whose system carries no aarch64 prefix takes
  # the false branch and emits nothing. The delivery codomain therefore cannot be observed
  # by firing, and the recovered empty head is not merely uninformative: the `delivery`
  # this body does emit at a real aarch64 host would abort against it.
  #
  # The linux and darwin arms are covered by den-compat's v1-name table; this one belongs
  # here instead, because a declaration on the source record is consulted before that
  # table, and which kinds a corpus policy produces is a fact the corpus owns.
