  # policy is empty and each home collects its own overlays as usual.

  # FOLLOW-UP: under useGlobalPkgs the home consumer in core/nix/nixpkgs.nix must
  # also be prevented from defining nixpkgs.* (home-manager asserts otherwise);
  # excluding the whole aspect cascades, so that gating is deferred.
