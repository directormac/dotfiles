# Shared dynamic settings type — recursively discovers aspects that declare a
# `.settings` block and mirrors the aspect tree into a typed submodule. Used by
# BOTH the host and cluster entity schemas so each exposes the SAME per-aspect
# settings namespace:
#   den.aspects.<path>.settings  →  host.settings.<path>.*
#                                →  cluster.settings.<path>.*
#
# Underscore prefix keeps import-tree from auto-importing this; host.nix and
# cluster.nix import it explicitly with `{ inherit den lib; }`.
