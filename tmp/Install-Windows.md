## Node Runtime

Using nvm(node version manager) refer to this [link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

```sh
scoop install nvm
# Run "nvim list available" after installation
```

Install a version e.g for latest use "latest" and for lts use "lts"

```sh
nvm install lts
```

Dependency Managers Install per nvim instance e.g

```sh
nvm use lts
# Using scoop to manage yarn and pnpm versions
scoop install pnpm yarn
```

Personal choice is pnpm additional steps

```sh
#https://pnpm.io/cli/dlx

```

### Rust

This package defaults to using the MSVC toolchain in new installs; use \"rustup set default-host\" to configure it,
(now equivalent to the rustup package),
According to [The Rust Book - Chapter 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows)
Microsoft C++ Build Tools is needed and can be downloaded <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/">here</a>!

When installing build tools, these two components should be selected:,

- MSVC - VS C++ x64/x86 build tools,
- Windows SDK

Or you can run this script below in powershell cause fuck microsoft!

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe' -OutFile "$env:TEMP\vs_BuildTools.exe"
& "$env:TEMP\vs_BuildTools.exe" --passive --wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended --remove Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.CMake.Project
```

```sh
# Install rustup through scoop
scoop install rustup-msvc
```

---

#### Other Runtimes

**[Python](https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/)**

```sh
scoop install pyenv@2.64.11 #other versions not working well
scoop hold pyenv
```

---

**[Java(JDK)](https://jdk.java.net/)** With android-clt

Flavours available openjdk, oraclejdk, oraclejdk-lts

```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoon install java/openjdk17 # Dependency
scoop install main/android-clt # Replaces Android SDK
scoop install extras/android-studio # Instructions Below
```

This is the only time you need to open it for initial setup and adding emulator
TODO: Discover how android-clt works didnt see any shims from scoop either have not found clear
docs about it either

1. Open Android Studio
2. It will ask for Android SDK after you install openjdk17 and android-clt this will be auto detected
3. Let it download what it needs next next next next next next and finish
4. Create an emulator run it for the first time

- Depending on your target version please select both its SDK for it and API Level

5. Forget you installed android studio 🤖
6. On running capacitor or ionic built apps please refer to guide below

For ionic and cordova and capacitor dependencies
commands like `npx cap open android` and `npx cap run android` wont work with this type of installation

test run time

```sh
pnpm create ionic-svelte-app@latest # select necessary steps and dependencies
#For HMR in dev mode rename _server to server in `capacitor.config.json`
pnpm cap add android # add android project
pnpm run build #
npx cap sync
explorer . #and open the directory android with android studio then trust the project
pnpm dev -- --open
```

Grable will do its thing and now you can select app and
run the app in dev mode with HMR from your SK app
